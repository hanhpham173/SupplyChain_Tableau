# 🚚 Supply Chain Dashboard – Tableau Project

## 📊 Overview  
This Tableau project delivers an interactive and visually engaging **Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard**. The focus is on tracking **shipment performance**, **inventory efficiency**, and **product availability** using real-time metrics. The dashboard empowers supply chain leaders to identify delays, optimize inventory levels, and align supply with demand.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
To develop a professional dashboard that supports operational visibility and decision-making by:

- Tracking supply chain delays and identifying root causes  
- Analyzing inventory mismatches across product categories  
- Monitoring shipment flows and market-level issues  
- Providing clear visualizations of just-in-time (JIT) metrics

---

## 🔄 Dashboard Features

### 1. 📦 Inventory Dashboard  
- **Supply vs. Demand**: Bubble chart comparing available inventory to customer demand  
- **Stock Levels by Category**: Line and bar charts showing inventory deltas for top 10 product categories  
- **Historical Stock Deviations**: Monthly view of overstock and understock patterns with color-coded signals

### 2. 🚢 Shipment Dashboard  
- **Delays Evolution**: Timeline of shipment delay severity and improvement over time  
- **Order Volume Trend**: Monthly breakdown of order quantity  
- **Market-Level Delays**: Global map visualizing delayed markets by region  
- **Shipment Investigation**: Area chart showing shipment classifications over time (delayed, on-time, early)

### 3. 📈 KPI Cards & Filters  
- **% of Delayed Orders**: Real-time metric card (e.g. 61%)  
- **Avg Shipment Delay**: Daily average across the time range (e.g. 0.5 days)  
- **Top N Selector**: Dynamic control to filter top categories by delay or volume  
- **Product Category Highlighter**: Spotlight trends by category

---

## 🧭 Dashboard Pages Overview

- **Shipment Dashboard**  
  Tracks delay evolution, maps delay concentration globally, and provides deep insights into order volume patterns and shipment classification trends.

- **Inventory Dashboard**  
  Highlights supply-demand imbalances, stock deltas, and demand fulfillment gaps across product categories and time.

- **Supply Chain Story**  
  Presents narrative insights into delay history, with annotations showing turning points and operational changes (e.g., "Until mid-2016, we have been experiencing large shipment delays").
---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📉 Shipment delays were consistently high until mid-2016, then improved significantly  
- 📊 Several product categories experience frequent understocking, with high negative deltas  
- 🌍 Shipment issues are heavily concentrated in specific global markets  
- 🕒 Demand peaks do not always align with inventory availability, leading to supply chain strain

---

## 📌 Recommendations

1. **Optimize Inventory Allocation**  
   Use the Supply vs. Demand matrix to rebalance stock by region and category.

2. **Reduce Delays with Supplier Collaboration**  
   Engage vendors with high late delivery trends to improve reliability.

3. **Investigate Underserved Markets**  
   Regions with chronic delays should be reviewed for logistics or fulfillment changes.

4. **Implement Dynamic Reordering Logic**  
   Adjust order cycles based on historical demand and inventory delta trends.
